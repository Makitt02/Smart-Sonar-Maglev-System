# Smart-Sonar-Maglev-System
Group #77 - Calcaholics
This project is meant to find the minimum needed force to hover for unique masses, which in return requires less energy as the electromagnets do not need to output a constant force all the time. Our system first gets the reading from the Sonar Sensor, which it interrupts the raw data and turns into tangible distances. It than uses the given optimal maglev hover distance to see if it is hovering in optimal space, if it is it will provide a 0N additional force based off of its displacement away from the optimal point. If it detects it is off the optimal point, our file calculates based on mass and the magnetic distance relation which is a 2nd power inverse relation, which provides how much force is needed to maintain optimal height. This reading allows us to know know the minimum force needed for load without ever knowing the mass of our load.
